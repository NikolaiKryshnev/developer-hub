## Ethereum: The Sacred Timeline of Finality

Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap aims to scale the usability of its decentralized and secure blockspace, bolstered by significant staking. While this approach enhances security and inclusivity (like solo stakers), it encounters a **finality problem**.

### Finality of Ordering
Ethereum operates on a probabilistic model where transactions aren't fully confirmed until after two epochsâ€”approximately 13 minutes under normal network conditions. Until this finality is reached:

- **Forks May Occur**: Ethereum can have different forks based on the transactions included in a block, leading to diverging views
- **Delayed Confirmations**: It can take significant time to finalize transactions (horizontal relationship to finality).

Thus, the primary settlement layer for rollups requires about 13 minutes to achieve finality, prompting the question: **How do rollups ensure they align with Ethereum's timeline?**

These factors are typically defined in the native bridge of a rollup at the time of deployment.
