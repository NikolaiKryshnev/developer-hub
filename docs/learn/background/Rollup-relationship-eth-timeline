# Rollup's Relationship to Ethereum Timeline
Every rollup anchors to Ethereum via its L1Origin, defining its position on the timeline. The depth at which a rollup follows Ethereum matters:

- **Shallow Depth** (e.g., Optimism at 4 blocks):
    - Less delay but higher risk if Ethereum forks.
- **Greater Depth**:
    - More confirmations reduce the risk of following a forked timeline.

### Consequences of Tracking the Wrong Timeline

If a rollup follows an incorrect Ethereum fork:
- The rollup must switch to the correct timeline upon Ethereum's finalization.
- Transactions executed on the wrong timeline revert to the mempool.
- The sequencer replays these transactions; failure to catch up may lead to state reversion i.e a reorg as seen in the 2-week reorg on Degen Chain.

# The Space-Time Gap Between Rollups

<br/>

Rollups anchor themselves to Ethereum at specific points on the blockchain known as **L1Origin**. Depending on their L1Origin, rollups can be at different places on Ethereum's timeline. In the worst-case scenario, they might even be following a different fork of Ethereum entirely.

<br/>

This situation has important implications:

- **State Dependency on Ethereum's View**: Each rollup's state is contingent upon the Ethereum chain it follows. Since Ethereum achieves finality after about 13 minutes (two epochs), the chain a rollup follows might not be the finalized one. This means the rollup's state is provisional until Ethereum finalizes its chain.
- **Risk of Reorganizations (Reorgs)**: If rollups are anchored to different forks of Ethereum, at least one will be following a non-canonical chain. When Ethereum finalizes its correct (canonical) chain, rollups on the wrong fork will have to reorganize their blockspace to align with the finalized chain. Transactions processed on the incorrect fork will be reverted and need to be re-executed on the correct timeline.

<br/>

Because rollups are tied to specific state of Ethereum they follow (as defined in their native bridge contracts), there's an inherent **gap** between them. This gap arises due to Ethereum's finality period—the time it takes for blocks to become immutable (approximately 13 minutes). Until finality is reached, rollups may not be perfectly synchronized.

By understanding this space-time gap, we recognize that the interoperability between rollups is affected by:

- **Ethereum's Finality Lag**: The delay before blocks are finalized introduces temporal separation between rollups.
- **Potential Forks and Reorgs**: Rollups following non-finalized or incorrect Ethereum forks risk significant reorganization of their blockspace.

This gap emphasizes the importance of considering Ethereum's finality in rollup design and interoperability solutions, as it directly impacts the reliability of rollup states.

# Nexus of 1000s of Rollups

With over 200 rollups and growing, tracking each rollup's alignment with Ethereum is becoming complex. Although Ethereum rarely experiences deep reorgs (typically up to 2 blocks and max seen upto 7 blocks), even minor discrepancies can disrupt closely following rollups.

Bringing rollups closer in blockspace is crucial, especially as transaction times decrease (e.g., milliseconds for rollups like MegaETH). High finality gap between rollups hinders application development, forcing new rollups to repeatedly deploy the same primitives instead of focusing on specialized use cases.

## Polymer Hub: Uniting Ethereum Rollup Blockspace

Polymer Hub is a networking protocol designed to connect Ethereum rollups by sharing state updates between them. This mechanism is similar to the IBC protocol, where a blockchain receives light client updates from a counterpart chain. By facilitating the exchange of state updates, Polymer Hub enables rollups to verify any event log on any other chain.

To ensure that rollups communicating within the finality gap are on the correct fork of Ethereum, Polymer Hub operates as a rollup on Ethereum itself. Being a rollup allows it to be directly connected to both Ethereum and other rollups, ensuring consistency and alignment across the network.

- Rollups A, B and C will be allowed to communicate with each other in real time.
- But any state updates going to B to A’ will fail the Ethereum consistency check as A’ is on a different fork. The same is true with B’ trying to communicate with others.

This design addresses the challenges posed by the finality gap and fosters a more unified rollup ecosystem.
