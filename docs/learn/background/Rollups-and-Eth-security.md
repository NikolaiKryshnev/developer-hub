# Rollups and Ethereum Security
Rollups scale Ethereum by offloading execution overhead to an off-chain sequencer while inheriting Ethereum's security. They achieve this by:
1. **Tracking Ethereum's Timeline:**

   - Each rollup block associates with a corresponding Ethereum L1 block (known as **L1Origin**).
   - The L1Origin can be at various depths on Ethereum's timeline, even on a fork.
   - This is also how users bridge funds to the rollup via the native bridge, entering the off-chain environment, or force include transactions.
   - *In the example image above Base has already seen the L1 block Arbitrum is using as itâ€™s L1Origin since it is further in depth. However, Base is unaware Optimism as it is too early in depth.*
2. **Sequencer Posting Transactions to L1 (DA):**
   - The sequencer batches transactions (ordered) and posts them on L1 for data availability.
   - Ethereum takes it own time to finalizes this batch transaction (containing the ordering), ensuring the sequencer cannot alter transaction ordering in future, reducing the need for trust.
3. **Proposing the Rollup State Root to L1**:
    - The rollup computes the state root by executing transactions from the posted data batches, and then proposes it on Ethereum.
    - A challenge window (typically 7 days) begins, allowing anyone to submit a fault proof.
    - Users experience a 7-day exit delay due to this challenge window.

## Rollup's Relationship to Ethereum Timeline
Every rollup anchors to Ethereum via its L1Origin, defining its position on the timeline. The depth at which a rollup follows Ethereum matters:

- **Shallow Depth** (e.g., Optimism at 4 blocks):
    - Less delay but higher risk if Ethereum forks.
- **Greater Depth**:
    - More confirmations reduce the risk of following a forked timeline.

### Consequences of Tracking the Wrong Timeline

If a rollup follows an incorrect Ethereum fork:
- The rollup must switch to the correct timeline upon Ethereum's finalization.
- Transactions executed on the wrong timeline revert to the mempool.
- The sequencer replays these transactions; failure to catch up may lead to state reversion i.e a reorg as seen in the 2-week reorg on Degen Chain.
