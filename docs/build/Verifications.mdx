## Background

Polymer Hub allows developers to choose between different client types, each managing the latest state of a connecting rollup on Polymer Hub. These clients are crucial for validating packets sent between various rollups.

:::tip State Management

Polymer Hub serves as the state manager for communicating rollups, relying on the rollup's chain state instead of individual transactions.

:::

All Polymer Hub clients are based on the rollup's architecture i.e how a rollup is communicating its latest state to Ethereum via the Native Rollup Bridge. Since rollups are designed to be faster, there’s an inherent lag between the Sequencer’s off-chain view and the on-chain view on Ethereum.

:::tip Re-org Resistance

Our clients are designed around these critical pillars for rollup interoperability: **ordering** (re-org resistance) and **truth** (validity).

- **Ordering:** Finality of the state in question (Risk: Re-org and loss of transaction).
- **Truth:** Validity of the state transaction, i.e., execution of a transaction (Risk: Processing fraud).

Guaranteeing both safety properties is crucial for rollup-to-rollup interoperability.
